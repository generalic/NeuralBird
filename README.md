# NeuralBird
@FER - Software Design Project Course
Website: http://morgoth.zemris.fer.hr/data-repo/proj/1/

Project's goal was to develop our own implementation of the Flappy Bird game and to implement Neural Network which we trained using Genetic Algorithm in order to learn it to play the game.

Two gameplay modes are possible:
  1.) PLAY - Singleplayer mode, where player can play the game
  2.) PLAYAI - Trained Neural Newtork plays the game
The game mode can be customized in SETTINGS.

Game is implemented using Java 8 and JavaFX 8.
